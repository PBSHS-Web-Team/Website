        <p class="pb-3">Reverend Doctor Mun Sung Bae, the founder of Palawan Bethel Senior High School (PBSHS), is a Korean Christian missionary to the Philippines for 15 years. His works include helping the poor and reaching out to their communities through the kind-hearted Koreans who are touched by the Lord to help in this mission.</p>
        <p class="pb-3">The PBSHS is the realization of his vision to help the Filipino youth achieve their dreams and help their family and country by enhancing their employability locally as well as giving them the opportunity to work abroad especially in Korea, his birthplace.</p>
        <p class="pb-3">With the help of the Department of Education of the Philippines and the Filipino stakeholders, we make this dream a reality.</p>
