# Welcome to Palawan Bethel Senior High School ^_^

This website is intended to be part of K-12 Pyunghwa ICT student's
learning experience, enforcing the knowledge they acquire from a
seminar-type teaching about WWW basics, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The codes in this website are not optimized for performance. Instead,
it is deliberately maintained human-readable for student analysis.
We apologize for the experience if you see it as slow or buggy.

If you find anything that needs our attention, anything that needs
to discuss, please contact one of the following:
